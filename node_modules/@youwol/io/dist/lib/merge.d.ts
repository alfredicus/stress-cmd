 * Merge several objects loaded by any filter into one. Take care of the reindexation
 * of the topological elements if any (combinatorial elements of dim > 1, i.e., meshes lines,
 * meshed surfaces, meshed volumes).
 * Also, attributes (other series) are merged as well if and only if they have the same
 * name and itemSize.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { decodeGocadTS, merge } from '@youwol/io'
 *
 * const t1 = decodeGocadTS(bufferTS1)
 * const t2 = decodeGocadTS(bufferTS2)
 * const t3 = merge([...t1, ...t2])
 * ```
